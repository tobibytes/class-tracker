Class Tracker — Morgan State (built by a Morgan CS major)
Always know what’s next: your next class with countdown + room, today at a glance, and a clean weekly view.
Rename COSC354.001 to “Operating Systems”, add missing times/rooms once, and you’re done.
Private by default (your Canvas token stays in your browser). Works offline and on all devices.
