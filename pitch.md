What if your day at school felt calm and predictable? Class Tracker gives you a simple, beautiful view of your next class, today’s schedule, and the week ahead—without digging through Canvas or hunting for room numbers.

The problem it solves
- Canvas is great for coursework, but not for your day-to-day flow
- Cryptic course codes (like COSC354.001) don’t help you get to class on time
- Last‑minute room checks are stressful—especially when you’re on the move

The fix (in one glance)
- Next up: See your next class with a live countdown, time window, and room
- Today: Clean list of classes with an easy map pin when you need it
- Week: A clear, color‑coded timeline for planning

Why students love it
- Calm, not clutter: just what you need right now
- Human names for classes: rename COSC354.001 to “Operating Systems” once and forget about codes
- Offline‑friendly: loads instantly even on flaky Wi‑Fi—vital when you’re sprinting between buildings
- Works the way you do: add missing times/rooms once, auto‑refreshes every 30s

Why it’s different
- Private by default: your Canvas token stays in your browser; nothing is stored on the server
- Fast: zero friction to see what’s next
- Adaptable: rename courses, fill missing details, keep your own rhythm

How it works (quick)
1) Connect Canvas with your personal access token (kept in your browser)
2) Import courses automatically; rename classes to human‑friendly names
3) If Canvas doesn’t include times/rooms, add them once—done

Built for real life
- Auto‑refresh every 30 seconds (manual Refresh button too)
- Offline mode: keeps showing Next/Today from your cached schedule if you go offline
- Installable on all devices: add to Home Screen (iOS/Android) or install as a desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux) and launch it like an app

How to install (Home Screen / App)
- iPhone/iPad (Safari): tap Share → Add to Home Screen → Add

Who it’s for
- Morgan State students who want a calmer, faster way to move through their day
- Anyone who’s done playing “decode the course code” before each class

What you’ll feel
- Fewer last‑minute scrambles, more “I’ve got this”
- Less screen time spent hunting; more time doing

Call to action
- Try it for one day of classes—connect Canvas, rename your courses, and watch the stress go down
- Your day, at a glance. That’s Class Tracker.
