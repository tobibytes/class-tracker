Class Tracker

Always know what’s next.

Class Tracker is a simple, private dashboard that tells you:
- What your next class is (with a live countdown)
- Where you need to be (room, building, and a quick map link)
- Today’s schedule at a glance
- Your week’s classes in a clean, color‑coded timeline

Who it’s for
- Students who use Canvas and want a faster, calmer way to see their day
- Anyone tired of cryptic course names (e.g., COSC354.001) and bouncing between apps

What you can do
- Connect your Canvas once and import your courses
- Rename classes to human‑friendly names (e.g., “Operating Systems”)
- Fill in missing times/rooms when Canvas doesn’t provide them
- See everything update automatically every 30 seconds (or refresh anytime)
- Install it like an app on desktop or phone for instant access

Why you’ll love it
- Zero‑friction: open it, instantly see what’s next
- Private by default: your Canvas token stays in your browser; nothing is stored on the server
- Clear and calm: no clutter—just the next class, today, and your week
- Works offline for the UI shell, so it opens fast even on flaky Wi‑Fi

How it works (quick, non‑technical)
- Connect Canvas with your personal access token (stored only in your browser)
- If times or rooms are missing, add them once—they’re remembered locally
- The app keeps your view fresh with a 30‑second auto‑refresh

That’s it. No accounts to create. No complicated setup. Just your schedule—simple and fast.

For developers (very short)
- Self‑hosted, privacy‑first. React + Vite frontend and a Node/Express API.
- Canvas import is stateless; tokens are kept in the browser.
- Tech details and commands live in WARP.md.
