THE PROBLEM
- Canvas is great for coursework, but not for your day‑to‑day flow
- Cryptic course codes (like COSC354.001) don’t help you get to class on time
- Last‑minute room checks are stressful—especially when you’re on the move

THE FIX (IN ONE GLANCE)
- Next up: live countdown, time window, and room
- Today: clean list with a quick map pin
- Week: a clear, color‑coded timeline

WHY STUDENTS LOVE IT
- Calm, not clutter: just what you need right now
- Human names for classes: rename to “Operating Systems” and forget codes
- Offline‑friendly: opens fast even on flaky Wi‑Fi
- Works the way you do: add missing times/rooms once, auto‑refreshes every 30s

WHY IT’S DIFFERENT
- Private by default: your Canvas token stays in your browser; nothing stored on the server
- Fast: zero friction to see what’s next
- Adaptable: rename courses, fill missing details, keep your own rhythm

HOW IT WORKS (QUICK)
1) Connect Canvas with your personal access token (kept in your browser)
2) Import courses automatically; rename classes to human‑friendly names
3) If Canvas doesn’t include times/rooms, add them once—done
